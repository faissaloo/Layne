We're going to have a dictionary for every context,
when a new variable is declared we add an item to that dictionary
by the name of that variable
The C++ source is gonna be something like this

If the variable doesn't exist this will just abort
object.getVar("variableName")

This will handle setting, if the variable doesn't exist it gets created
object.setVar("variableName",whatever)
