ok so if we want to check if an object is a child of a given parent we should have a .__parent__ member variable then keep going through the .__parent__ variables until we reach an object that matches or we run out of parents (we'll need an object we know to stop descending at though otherwise objects that don't match can never not match or they'll crash instead of just returning false)
